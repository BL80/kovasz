## Sourdough only
Yes, it's all about sourdough here. Forget yeast and baking powder!

Recipes here take time, days. If you want to quickly bake something delicious, you're at the wrong place. This hobby requires patience. Working with sourdough is not only a workout, but also a meditation exercise, a kind of mental and physical training. I especially recommend it to people who are struggling with time management. If you do this, you will learn to manage your time and plan your week in advance.

Sourdough is a living creature, like a pet, it lives in the fridge and only asks to eat once a week.
