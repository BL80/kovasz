- Sprinkle 20g of salt on top of the dough (preferably sea salt).
- Pour a small amount of water onto the salt, just enough to dissolve it.
- You can start [kneading](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvQcmf6FzwN/) the dough. 
- Once you're done kneading, cover the dough with the mixing bowl and let it rest for 1 or 2 hours.

:::tip Hints for kneading
- Use sea salt instead of iodized salt, as iodized salt can kill the beneficial bacteria.
- If you feel that the dough is not soft or elastic enough, feel free to add more water and keep wetting your hands while kneading. This will prevent the dough from sticking too much.
- Do not add more flour at this point.
- Knead until the dough becomes elastic. It's okay if it's slightly more fluid, the important thing is that it stretches without breaking.
- The flour-to-water ratio is right when the dough slightly sticks to your hand but easily comes off.
- During the resting period, gently move and fold the dough every half hour.
