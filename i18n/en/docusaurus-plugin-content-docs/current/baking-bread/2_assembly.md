- Place 750g of flour into a bowl  
*You can also mix it to have 4/5 BL80 flour and 1/5 of another stronger flour such as BL200 or BL112, etc. The key is to ensure that at least 4/5 of the mixture is BL80 flour, as it is recommended for beginners and makes it easy to work with, almost impossible to mess up.* 😄
- Add `450g lukewarm water` ([500g for Garat flour](https://garatmalom.hu/)) to the bowl
- Finally, add the fed `500g sourdough starter` and [mix it](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bve4fH3lHyE/) just enough for the flour to absorb the water and form a large mass. Do not knead at this point! (see the photo below)
- Autolyse: Set it aside to rest for 1-2 hours (covered with a dough bowl)

:::tip Tips for autolyse
- I usually mix the ingredients with a silicone spatula instead of using my hands because it tends to get very sticky.
- Many people mix only the flour and water without adding the sourdough starter, but it's easier to add the starter right away. There's no difference, and it reduces the fussiness of the process.
- The key is to continue the autolyse until you add the salt. This process stops as soon as the salt is incorporated, so strictly no salt at this stage!
