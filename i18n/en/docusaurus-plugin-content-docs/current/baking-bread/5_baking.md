- In a preheated oven, the hotter the better!
- Place a ceramic dish with water on the bottom of the oven to create steam (if you are baking in a [Dutch oven](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3uvU4TAuD8/), you can skip this step, of course, as shown here).
- Once the oven is preheated, [transfer the dough from the proofing basket](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9vyQihBTsO/) to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
- Make a [score](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXFzpzfjpqG/) on the dough, but don't hesitate! Quickly place it in the preheated oven on the center rack.
- Bake at 230¬∞C for approximately 45 minutes with heat from the bottom.
- Remove the dish with water from the bottom of the oven, ‚ö†Ô∏è be careful as hot steam will escape! If you are using a Dutch oven, remove the lid.
- Switch to upper heat and bake for 15 more minutes until done ‚úîÔ∏è
- Once baked, take it out of the oven and place it on a cooling rack to cool down, preventing the bottom from getting soggy.
- Let it cool for at least 30 minutes if you can resist üòÑ

:::tip Hints for baking
- It is recommended to preheat the oven to the maximum temperature because when the dough is placed inside, the temperature decreases not only from opening the oven door but also due to the cold mass of dough taken out of the refrigerator.
- Scoring the dough is also a separate art form, and some people excel at it, creating intricate designs and patterns [resembling Michelangelo's frescoes](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9pBtUypbYG/) on the bread crust.
- If you don't wait for it to cool down, you won't be able to [properly slice](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByRNVVmgPJm/) it!
- You can't go wrong with fresh, warm bread ‚Äî it's always delicious!

Good luck, and just be skillful!
