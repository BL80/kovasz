- Take out from the `sourdough starter ~160g`
- Feed it => Give `170g flour` and `170g water` to it, mix it, cover it and let it ferment on room temperature eg. 2-4 hours  
🌡️ *Timing highly depends on the temperature, don't leave it over 40°C otherwise it will die!*
- Add back the missing 160g to the sourdough starter (so there's enough to bake next time 😉), which means adding 80g of flour and 80g of water, and then it can go straight back into the fridge

:::tip Hints for feeding sourdough
- The water should be at body temperature. It can be colder, which will slow down the fermentation process. It should never be warmer, as the sourdough will die at temperatures above 40°C!
- The sourdough is [mature](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8V-2BfgplN/) ([optimal for kneading](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx8NVDbAVg6/)), when it has doubled in size and has a domed top. If the top is already concave, it means it has started to retract, indicating that it has overproofed.
- The sourdough level can be easily marked using a canning rubber band.
- As shown in the top picture, it is clear that the sourdough has doubled in size, indicating that it is ready to be used.
- Another way to determine the readiness of the sourdough is by performing a float test. If you drop a small amount of it into water and it floats on the surface, it is ready to be used. (In other words, it is lighter than a 🦆, so it is a 🧹🪄🧙)
- The sourdough shown in the picture was fed with BL80 flour and at a temperature of 20-22°C, it takes approximately 3-4 hours to rise. This time can vary depending on the strength of the sourdough. If it hasn't been fed in a while, it will be slower, but if it has been regularly fed and is active, it will rise more quickly.
