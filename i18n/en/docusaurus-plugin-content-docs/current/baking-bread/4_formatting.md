- [Transfer the dough](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4eHtJtgAfw/) onto a lightly floured surface.
- If necessary, divide it into pieces to fit in the proving basket.
- [Shape it](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2XQbU2Amiy/) into a round loaf and [place it in the proving basket](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzBvaJMAqkT/).
- For same-day baking: Let it rest at room temperature, covered with a cloth, for 3 hours.
- For next-day baking: Place it in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.

:::tip Hints for folding
- Make sure the kitchen towel in the [proving basket](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9tIY9IgbL_/) is generously dusted with flour to prevent sticking.
- A wooden proving basket doesn't require a cloth or flour, except for the first use.
- Shaping and folding the bread is an art in itself. There are plenty of beautiful folding techniques and tricks on Instagram. However, if you don't have time or inclination, you can skip it and shape the bread directly, then into the proving basket it goes. But be aware that if you don't fold it properly every half hour, you might not achieve the characteristic "angel's bed" texture in the bread.
