# ![](/img/icons/kovasz_48px.svg) What you should know about sourdough starter

## What is sourdough made of?
...the question arises. The answer is surprisingly simple: water and flour.


### Required tools and equipment

- Mason jar or plastic container. The key is to avoid using metal as the sourdough is acidic.
- Breathable cover, such as a kitchen towel.

If you have a jar with a clamp lid, that's perfect. Just remove the rubber gasket from it so that it doesn't seal airtight.

1. Place 150g of flour (whole wheat recommended) and water into a large glass jar, mix them together, and cover it.
1. Let it sit in a warm place for 12-24 hours.
1. Discard half of the mixture and replace it with 75g of flour and water.
1. Thoroughly mix it together, cover it, and wait for another 12-24 hours.

Repeat the process from step 3 until bubbles start to appear and its volume visibly increases. This can take up to 10 days in moderate climates, but fermentation may start as early as 3-4 days in warmer environments.

Once fermentation has developed, transfer it to the refrigerator.

## This is how you revive dried sourdough starter
>⚒️ Net working time: ~5-10 min per day  
>🕒 Gross preparation time: 1-2 days 🌞

:::tip
It is recommended to start rehydrating the dried sourdough starter in the evening before going to bed or in the morning before heading to work, so that by the time you come home/wake up, you can continue working with it.
:::

- Take about 15-20g of dried sourdough starter, break it into small pieces, and place it in a jar.
- Add the same amount of water as the weight of the dried starter and wait for it to dissolve. It may take around 8-10 hours.
- The next morning, or when the mixture has turned into a slimy goo, add the same amount of water and flour as the weight of the goo, and let it rest for another 8-10 hours.
- At this point, there should be bubbles present, and you should notice a significant increase in volume.
- Feed the starter and it's ready for baking, or store it in the refrigerator for later use.

If you need further assistance, you can also find numerous videos on YouTube about this topic. This video was the most appealing to me, but it might be because I like the guy's hairstyle. 👨‍🦲

## Tips and Tricks
### I'm going on vacation, what should I do to make sure the sourdough survives?
- Feed it well 2 days before you leave, as well as the day before your departure. For the last feeding, make the consistency thicker by adding more flour than water. For example, you can use 60g of water and 100g of flour.
- When you return, feed your starter twice before using it for baking to help it regain its strength.

Alternatively, you can create a dried sourdough starter. This involves taking a portion of your active starter, feeding it, and then spreading it thinly on a silicone mat or parchment paper. Allow it to dry completely. The dried sourdough starter can last for thousands of years.

### Its appearance is terrible and it has a horrible smell, is this normal?
In short, no. The sourdough should not have an unpleasant smell. There should also be no spots or mold in it. If it has a terrible smell, it is likely that the wrong bacteria have taken over. This usually happens when it comes into contact with other fermenting substances and some unrelated organisms have colonized it.

Unfortunately, you will need to discard it and start the sourdough-making process again.

### Is it OK if there is a grayish liquid on the top?
Yes, it is a protective layer called "hooch", consisting of water and alcohol. It helps protect the sourdough from foreign bacteria. It indicates that the sourdough has been hungry, so we should feed it a few times to restore its strength.
